# DBM-Add-Ons
Actions, Events and Extensions made for experts of Discord Bot Maker.

## Installation & Usage

1. Install the actions, events and extensions which you want to use (aaa_dbm_addons_dependency_ADDON.js is always required!)
2. Edit settings.json or simply use the DBM Add-Ons Settings extension to configure the Dependency how you like
3. Run your project via the command line

## Warning

- The DBM Add-Ons are currently only compatible with Discord Bot Maker [Beta]
- Be sure that no other action, event and extension overwrites stuff, that the DBM Add-Ons Dependency already did. This can cause serious issues
